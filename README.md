To become familiar with Verilog and the Altera Quartus-II FPGA compiler

<strong><em>Procedure:</em></strong>

<ol>

 <li>Read the “DE1_User_Manual.pdf” <strong>before coming to Lab</strong>. Specifically, read Chapters 1 and 2. Then, Read Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 carefully.</li>

 <li>Follow the instructions in the “Altera_FPGA_Tutorial.pdf” and then implement and test the two- input logic gates.</li>

 <li>Modify your code from #2 above and implement and test the following circuit. Build a 2 to 4 decoder circuit, with one enable input,  (as shown below) and use the four outputs from the decoder to drive a seven segment display with the appropriate numbers from the decoder (0 through 4). Where not enabled = 0, y[0] = 1, y[1] = 2, y[2] = 3, and y[3] = 4.</li>

</ol>

In addition to the standard lab report, include in your lab report’s description:

<ol>

 <li>Modified source code.</li>

 <li>Truth table and Boolean equations for each LED segment.</li>

 <li>Table reflecting the pin assignments from the source code variables to the LED segment identifiers.</li>

</ol>
